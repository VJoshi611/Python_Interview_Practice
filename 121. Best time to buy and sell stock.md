Given an array prices[] of length N, representing the prices of the stocks on different days, the task is to find the maximum profit possible for buying and selling 
the stocks on different days using transactions where at most one transaction is allowed.

Note: Stock must be bought before being sold.

Examples:

Input: 

prices[] = {7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]

Output: 5

Explanation:

The lowest price of the stock is on the 2nd day, i.e. price = 1. Starting from the 2nd day, the highest price of the stock is witnessed on the 5th day, i.e. price = 6. 
Therefore, maximum possible profit = 6 â€“ 1 = 5. 

Input: 

prices[] = {7, 6, 4, 3, 1} 

Output: 0

Explanation: 

Since the array is in decreasing order, no possible way exists to solve the problem

class Solution:

    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:

        purchase = prices[0]
        sell = purchase
        profit = 0

        for price in prices:
            if price > sell:
                sell = price
                profit = max(sell - purchase, profit)
            if price < purchase:
                purchase = price
                sell = price

        return profit

    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:

        minvalue = prices[0]
        maxprofit = 0
        
        for i in range(1,len(prices)):
            if prices[i] < minvalue :
                minvalue = prices[i]
            elif prices[i] - minvalue  > maxprofit :
                maxprofit = prices[i] - minvalue
        return maxprofit

### function definition
### Time complexity: O(n)
### Space complexity: O(1)

def findmaxProfit(prices):

    min_price = float('inf')
    max_profit = 0
    
    for i in range(len(prices)):
        if prices[i] < min_price:
            min_price = prices[i]
        elif prices[i] - min_price > max_profit:
            max_profit = prices[i] - min_price
    return max_profit

### Driver code 
prices = [7,5,3,6,4,15,20]
### function calling
maxProfit = findmaxProfit(prices)

print("The maximum profit of buy and sell the stock is:", maxProfit)
