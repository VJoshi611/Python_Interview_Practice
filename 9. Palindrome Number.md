# 9. Palindrome Number

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: x = 121

Output: true

Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Example 2:

Input: x = -121

Output: false

Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
