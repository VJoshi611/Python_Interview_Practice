# 75. Sort Colors
Medium

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Example 1:

Input:  nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]

Output:  [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Example 2:

Input:  nums = [2,0,1]

Output:  [0,1,2]


*we can use merge sort but the complexity will be O(nlogn). There are only three unique values in array and hence we can use two pointer approach. store 0 zeros at extreme 
left and 2 at extreme right position and one will automatically get stored. Here TC : O(N)*

solution :

- Time Complexity : O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

def sortColors(nums):

    p0 = curr = 0
    p2 = len(nums) - 1
    
    while curr <= p2:
        if nums[curr] == 0:
            ## swap nums[curr] and nums[p0]
            nums[p0], nums[curr] = nums[curr], nums[p0]
            p0 += 1
            curr += 1
        elif nums[curr] == 2:
            ## swap nums[curr] and nums[p2]
            nums[p2], nums[curr] = nums[curr], nums[p2]
            p2 -= 1
        else:
            curr += 1
    return nums

nums = [0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2]

result = sortColors(nums)

print(result)
